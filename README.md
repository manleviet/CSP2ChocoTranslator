# CSP2ChocoTranslator

A translator, using the ANTLR4 runtime for parsing, enables converting CSP constraints into Choco Solver commands.

## Features

- Translate simple constraints in the form of __[variable]__ __[comparative op]__ __[variable/integer]__
- Support IntVar variables (either positive or negative)
- Support comparative operators: =, !=, >, >=, <, <=
 
## How to use

*coming soon*

## TODOs:

- Try the annotator of ANTLR4 to share information among event methods
- Catching errors
- Extending the form of constraints
- Support relative operators: !, &&, ||.
